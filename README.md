# california-house-price-prediction-api
An end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting California housing prices. This project demonstrates the complete model lifecycle: from training and hyperparameter tuning with Scikit-Learn, to experiment tracking and model registry using MLflow, culminating in a real-time inference API built with FastAPI.
